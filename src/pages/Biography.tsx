      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm James Zheng, a passionate software developer and a tech lover currently pursuing a
          Master's degree in Software Development. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in
          the spring of 2023 and went right into pursing my second degree here at Boston University. I have lived
          here locally in the Boston area for majority of my live. I have always been surrounded by technology and fascinated
          by the impact of how they shape our lives. I have learned that most of the things we see everyday and use are programmed
          by coding, which led me to the world of software engineering and development. Through my studies and many course projects,
          I find myself drawn to front-end development where I can use my creativity to design intuitive user interfaces that can be
          engaged. I enjoy the challenge of breaking down problems and finding elegant solutions. My projects, whether academic or
          personal, reflect my commitment to producing high-quality, efficient software. Iâ€™m always looking for new opportunities
          to apply my skills and collaborate with others to build innovative software solutions. Thank you for visiting my portfolio,
          and I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals in the tech community! If want to learn more about me
          I have other pages you should visit.
